# Data Structures

## Basic Structures:

    [ ] Arrays - fixed size, contiguous memory
    [ ] Vectors - dynamic arrays
    [ ] Linked Lists - implement both singly and doubly linked
    [ ] Stack - LIFO implementation
    [ ] Queue - FIFO implementation

## Intermediate Structures:

    [ ] Binary Search Tree - basic implementation
    [ ] Hash Table - with collision handling
    [ ] Heap - both min and max heap
    [ ] Deque - double-ended queue
    [ ] Circular Buffer - fixed-size circular queue

## Advanced Structures:

    [ ] AVL Tree - self-balancing BST
    [ ] Red-Black Tree - self-balancing BST
    [ ] Trie - for string operations
    [ ] Graph - adjacency list and matrix implementations
    [ ] Priority Queue - using heap

## Bonus Challenges:

    [ ] Implement a custom allocator
    [ ] Create a thread-safe data structure
    [ ] Build a LRU Cache
    [ ] Implement a Skip List
    [ ] Create a B-Tree
