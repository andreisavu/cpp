### Hello World

A back-to-basics adventure with C++ and Bazel on algorithms, file formats, services, and more.

### What's on the list?

* [ ] Parquet (including Thrift for metadata)
* [ ] Various encoding and compression algorithms
* [ ] Iceberg (REST API) 
* [ ] Postgres (with a focus on the logical replication protocol as a source of events)
* [ ] S3 API (as a filesystem abstraction)

Maybe at some point also combining it all into a story about Zero-ETL to Iceberg and real-time analytics over Postgres data. That would be a fun project to prototype.

### How to run the code

All tests can be run with:

```
bazel test ...
```
